        <p>The syllabus of the course is designed to guide you from an absolute beginner in blockchain technology to be able to work with smart contracts.</p>
<p>When you complete this course, there is an avenue for you to apply your knowledge with OpenNodes Campus Collective. This will grant you more opportunities to scope and create your own activities together with the Campus Leads. To do this, there is a test you have to complete. <a href="https://youdonottalkaboutbcclub.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Try your hand at the challenge here</a>.</p>
<p>Phase 0: The content is designed for people who have never heard about blockchain. When you are done with this phase, you should be conversant in blockchain content. This means you should be able to read and discuss blockchain content you find off the net.</p>
<p>Phase 1: Armed with some knowledge of blockchain, this segment will help you identify the suitability of use cases in blockchain and give you an idea of what the ecosystem is like.</p>
<p>Phase 2: Non-technical folks may try the challenge after completing this phase. It will teach you how to interact with the test net. You will learn how to come up with your own use cases for blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Phase 3: For the technical folks, this phase will teach you how to work with smart contracts. There will be just enough solidity taught for you to follow. The content is made so that you will learn major classes of smart contracts simplified for you to understand the logic. Thereafter, you may try your hand at the challenge.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>What</h2>
<p><em>All  power is distributed and dispersed away from a central authority. Most financial and government systems currently in existence are centralized, which means that in such systems there exists a central authority that is incharge of maintaining and managing them.</em></p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 547.00px" src="img\6c8198d9ca047649.png"></p>
<p><em>There are several forms of decentralisation with varying degrees for each form leading to different properties and tradeoffs.</em></p>
<p>You can be decentralised in terms of architecture, culture, control, and decision-making.</p>
<ul>
<li>Architecture sets forth the different roles of network participants and how they interact. A highly decentralised architecture will ensure that all peers  have the exact same role and thus exert the same level of influence. A centralised architecture would give a single peer near full control of the network while other participants may only interact with it in limited ways. This can also affect the consensus protocols peers use.</li>
<li>Culture defines the social norms of the people that interact with the network. This could be in terms of the developers that build the software of the network, developers that build applications on the network, researchers that explore the potential and pitfalls of the network, and anyone that essentially has a stake in it.</li>
<li>Control of the network can be done in several ways but ultimately resulting in the governing of the network&#39;s participants. This may involve legal structures as to how the network is funded or the amount of changes each peer can make on the network itself.</li>
<li>Decision-making processes determine the growth of each network and help in the weighing of trade-offs that might have to be taken. As the technology is new, there are challenges that are unsolved and unforeseen. Having a robust decision-making process is important to ensure that the network can evolve to adapt to each challenge, social or technical.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This concept is fundamental to blockchain technology as it is its key value proposition for most use cases.</em></p>
<p>Decentralization can be viewed from a blockchain perspective as a mechanism that provides a way to remodel existing applications and paradigms or build new applications in order to give full control to users. There are conflicting ideas on the importance of decentralisation but most agree that it removes the need for trust when parties collaborate. This gives rise to new types of goods and services that are still untested.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Issues</h2>
<p>Scaling – there are challenges in keeping a network decentralized if one intends to scale. A common problem is the transaction speed, which plagued Ethereum for quite a while. Some solutions involve lowering levels of decentralization as a tradeoff for faster transactions, but it fundamentally lowers the level of security of the network due to the need for trusted parties (eg. Supernodes)</p>
<p>Economics – as a network grows, one cannot predict how its peers might interact when utilising the resources a network provides. This might lead to levels of centralization in a network. (Mining power centralization, Centralised exchanges)</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Why</h2>

<p>Nonce - an abbreviation for &#34;number only used once,&#34; which is a number added to a hashed—or encrypted—block in a blockchain that, when rehashed, meets the difficulty level restrictions. They are the numbers that miners are solving for. </p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>What</h2>
<p><em>All interaction is made reliable by making it unchangeable by any single party, ensuring that activity records and network participation rules are agreed and kept until all necessary parties agree to change them.</em></p>
<p>The structure of the blockchain itself affords the ability for individuals to independently verify the current state of the network. Each peer can compute the blockchain records for themselves to replicate the changes in the state of the network. A malicious peer will have to compute the consensus protocol for blocks already mined and then outcompete all the miners and broadcast their blocks first to every peer.</p>
<p>Consensus protocols cannot be easily changed and require a fork.</p>
<p>A fork can also be used to roll back records but it requires most peers to agree to the fork.</p>
<p><em>This makes digital goods act like real physical goods and not just a digital representation.</em></p>
<p>When records can no longer be easily changed by any single party, this creates a new type of good that is purely digital. This is because previously, people could simply make copies and replicate the good, thus no digital good is scarce. The immutability of the records achieved through decentralisation means that the state of such a good must be agreed upon by the entire network, analogous to physical goods that can be verified independently through sight or touch.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Issues</h2>
<p>Hard forks - rewriting large portions of the blockchain means that records are not absolutely immutable</p>
<p>Irreversibility - wrong actions once accepted and confirmed by the network cannot be easily reversed. Data on the blockchain will stay on the blockchain. Vulnerable smart contracts can be easily decompiled and exploited. The infamous <a href="https://pastebin.com/CcGUBgDG" target="_blank">DAO attacker left his message</a> to the Ethereum Community. <a href="https://www.etherchain.org/tx/d3d4483662185863cde4326ccf5205204adbcda33468587e8153de3fb83a9a37" target="_blank">See it for yourself</a> in the blockchain explorer where multiple transactions were made resulting in a loss of $70M.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Why</h2>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Sets forth a new paradigm by no longer requiring record-keeping intermediaries</li>
<li>Overcomes the need for trust in records kept as you can verify independently</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>How</h2>
<p>In Blockchain systems, the transactions that are verified are embedded with a time stamp that are secured through hashes. The hash of any new record links together and incorporates the hash of the previous record. Through this we get a chronological chain that joins each block.</p>
<p>Since the entire hashing process always includes the metadata of the previous block while generating a hash for any new block, an &#34;unbreakable&#34; link between the block and the chain is established. After this no further modifications [such as deletion and alteration] can be made to the block that has been included in the chain. If anyone does attempt this, subsequent blocks of the blockchain do not accept the modification as the hash of the block wouldn&#39;t be valid anymore. </p>
<p>In Summary:</p>
<p>New records - keep the hash of the previous block and a unique nonce, miners compete to find the nonce for the next block </p>
<p>Old records -  easily verified that previous blocks are correct by hashing the blocks and checking that the nonces are correct</p>

        <aside class="warning"><p>Terms</p>
<p>Address - A blockchain address is similar to an email address which is used to receive and send funds/transaction on the blockchain network</p>
<p>Mining - is a process through which new bitcoins are launched onto the market. People that are in charge are the &#34;miners&#34; and they work with powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions.  </p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>What</h2>
<p><em>The ability to hide the link between transactions and addresses are important due to privacy concerns</em></p>
<p>You can match the transaction to the address on the blockchain itself quite easily. When you go to a block explorer and view any block, you will see every transaction in the block, the miner, and any part of the block structure.</p>
<p>The pseudonymity that comes with most blockchains is that the address is not traced to a physical identity.</p>
<p><em>Even though the blockchain is considered public and immutable, individual transactions can be anonymous.</em></p>
<p>It&#39;s this pseudonymity that made blockchain technology an ideal method for illegal activity in its earlier days such as through <a href="https://fortune.com/2017/10/02/bitcoin-sale-silk-road/" target="_blank">Silk Road</a>.</p>
<p>However once an address is linked to an individual, this pseudonymity is immediately broken and can be <a href="https://www.ifca.ai/fc14/papers/fc14_submission_11.pdf" target="_blank">easily traced</a>.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Issues</h2>
<p>The problems with being traceable is the lack of privacy. One key concern is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> that would make it impossible to conduct business on the blockchain. </p>
<p>Time - privacy schemes <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/63691/how-much-time-to-generate-a-proof-in-zk-snark" target="_blank">take longer to compute</a> and might severely impact usability of blockchain applications.</p>
<p>That being said, there are new encryption schemes such as <a href="https://medium.com/hashed-official/homomorphic-blockchain-1f7db66ac2f7" target="_blank">homomorphic encryption</a> that might help resolve this.</p>

<p>Supply chains contain complex networks of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, auditors, and consumers.

Additionally, a shared infrastructure would provide auditors with greater visibility into participants&#39; activities along the value chain.</p>
<p><strong>Traceability</strong> improves operational efficiency by mapping and visualizing enterprise supply chains. A growing number of consumers demand sourcing information about the products they buy.

        <p><strong>You cannot mention blockchain without first understanding Bitcoin</strong>. <strong>It sets forth the very first principles and ideas that made blockchain technology possible.</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin&#39;s consensus protocol was revolutionary at that time and has become contentious recently due to energy concerns, mining centralisation, and up-and-coming ‘new&#39; consensus protocols. But let&#39;s start with the original.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 569.00px" src="img\160721d0219d5687.png"></p>
<p> Bitcoin also set forth the original protocol and all network participants have to follow. This was key as it was the first decentralised and public method for individuals to transfer value.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="P1: Web3 and the future of the internet" duration="10">
        <aside class="special"><p>TLDR: <strong>Blockchain + Internet = Web3</strong>. Blockchain is the decentralized backend for web3 applications. Apps on the Web3 are usually called <strong>dApps </strong>(Decentralized applications).</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>WWW and Web2</h2>
<p>Before we delve into what web3 is, let us first understand the current developments in the internet space - WWW and Web 2.0. </p>
<p>The Internet and WWW provided a <strong>data transmission protocol</strong> – TCP/IP – that made the transfer of data between any two remote computers faster and massively reduced the transaction costs of information exchange. Ten years later, the Internet became more mature and programmable. We saw the rise of the so-called Web2, which brought us social media and e-commerce platforms. The Web2 revolutionized social interactions, bringing producers and consumers of information, goods, and services closer together, and allowed us to enjoy P2P interactions on a global scale, but always with a <em>middleman</em>: a platform acting as a trusted intermediary between two people who do not know or trust each other. While these platforms have done a fantastic job of creating a P2P economy, with a sophisticated content discovery and value settlement layer, they also dictate all rules of the transactions, and they control all data of their users.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Need for Web3: Sticking it to the <em>Middle</em>Man</h2>
<p>By now, most of you might have connected the dots between the previously covered topics in this course and why we need Web3. The answer is plain and simple: remove the middleman in transactions. This has the effect of decentralisation, privacy, no single point of failure and many more as covered in the previous sections.</p>
<p>Currently, the internet uses a centralised system where clients send requests to a server.</p>
<p>In the Web3, data is stored in multiple copies of a P2P network (read: blockchain). The management rules are formalized in the protocol and secured by majority consensus of all network participants, who are incentivized with a native network token for their activities. Blockchain, as the backbone of the Web3, redefines the data structures in the backend of the Web. It introduces a governance layer that runs on top of the current Internet, that allows for two people who do not know or trust each other to reach and settle agreements over the Web.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 485.00px" src="img\f2fad6766522df5e.png"> </p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Accessing Web3: Another dark web?</h2>
<p>Some of you might think that just a web browser like Chrome/Safari might be sufficient to access the data and write to the blockchain. Others might think that you need to install something special like TOR. Well, actually, it&#39;s somewhere in the <em>middle</em>.</p>
<p>Since you need an account to sign and transact on the blockchain, you need a wallet. <a href="https://metamask.io/index.html" target="_blank">MetaMask</a> is a very popular Chrome extension crypto wallet. It is your gateway into dApps. Make sure you install it to enter the deep dark world of Web3! There are other wallets too, like Dapper, but MetaMask is the most famous one and we recommend that you use MetaMask for this course.</p>
<p>MetaMask stores all your blockchain network tokens and sometimes spends your tokens to write to the blockchain (reading doesn&#39;t require spending any tokens, we will cover that in our gas optimization topic). You cannot interact with the blockchain without a wallet. Your wallet and your wallet address is basically your anonymous identity on the blockchain!</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="P1: Blockchain Decision Models" duration="10">
        <p>A decision model is a formal system used for perceiving, organizing, and managing the business logic behind a business decision. We will now break down the IBM model to evaluate whether or not one should use a blockchain. </p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\7a5f1fe720987844.png"></p>
<p>The main idea that the entire model encapsulates, is that a problem to which blockchain would be a possible solution is one that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Works with contractual agreements and makes use of complex business logics: The property of immutability of the blockchain comes in handy here to ensure that contracts and other legal documents are tamper proof. Moreover smart contracts provide more security when compared to traditional contract laws and also reduce other transactional costs associated with contracting. </li>
<li>Requires you to keep your transactions private: The property of traceability of blockchains which allow addresses to not be traced to a physical identity makes the blockchain a perfect solution to such problems. </li>
<li>Requires a market approach: This problem can be further analysed and broken down into three other key factors to consider before deciding to adopt a blockchain solution</li>
<li>Whether the potential use case requires greater than two parties: If the answer is YES, then a blockchain solution can come in handy, since decentralized networks give each participant the flexibility to create their own customised solutions using proprietary logic while still keeping it running on a common ledger </li>
<li>Whether the potential adopter is looking to lower his/her costs: If the answer is YES, then once again a solution revolving around the blockchain would be of use since deploying a blockchain solution can help reduce overhead expenditure. This is done by significantly lowering transaction costs since cryptocurrency payments are handled in a peer to peer network with no centralized authority, which translates into lower merchant processing fees. </li>
<li>Whether it is important that discoverability is improved: This can be done through a solution making use of the blockchain since every peer in the decentralized network has access to the same ledger, making it easy to broadcast an intention. </li>
</ul>

<h2 is-upgraded>SoK: Blockchain Technology and Its Potential Use Cases (2019)</h2>
<p>Ruoti, S., Kaiser, B., Yerukhimovich, A., Clark, J., &amp; Cunningham, R. (2019). SoK: Blockchain technology and its potential use cases. <em>arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.12454</em>.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Abstract</h3>
<p>This paper mainly aims to answer the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly is Blockchain technology?</li>
<li>What capabilities does it provide?</li>
<li>What are good applications for Blockchain technology?</li>
<li> How does it relate to other distributed technologies [Such as distributed databases]?</li>
</ul>
<p>It uses <em>grounded theory</em> to achieve this, identifying data and processes within qualitative data sources generated by humans and filled with imprecise terminology and descriptions.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Key Contributions</h3>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 463.98px" src="img\580a04162a4b8063.png"></p>
<p>The technical properties for Blockchain Technology are defined which form the basis for its capabilities. Through participation in the <strong>shared governance and operations</strong> of the system, the group of individuals can be rest assured that the system is being operated properly. This is guaranteed through the validation rules which culminate in the consensus protocol for the distributed ledger.</p>
<p>The distributed ledger provides a <strong>verifiable state</strong> for the participants which accurately reflect their transactions.</p>
<p>It also provides <strong>resilience to data loss</strong> by providing redundancy.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\e033c4f9042bc602.png"></p>
<p>Blockchain Technology is commonly touted to have several different capabilities. This figure helps us make sense of the technical properties and primitives that lead to these capabilities. Blockchain&#39;s 3 core capabilities are the <strong>shared governance and operations</strong>, <strong>verifiable state</strong>, and <strong>resilience to data loss</strong>. An additional 11 capabilities are identified that can be achieved on or off-chain. Blockchain use cases develop from the creation of value from these capabilities.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\43354403db4ecbe0.png"></p>
<p>You might then be wondering to yourself how does blockchain compare to other types of decentralized databases. This paper provides a flowchart that helps you to understand this based on 4 key questions. </p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>operational model</strong> if the database is shared or not; </li>
<li>The <strong>root of trust</strong> for the database grounding it in either the maintainer or the system</li>
<li>Whether the database is <strong>auditable</strong> in terms of its provenance; and</li>
<li>What the database is <strong>resilient against</strong> by looking at how it might prevent or detect data loss.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\e7ccd5ff38f8be77.png"></p>
<p>Finally, the paper illustrates some normative properties for Blockchain Technology and illustrates the dependencies to achieve these properties. However, the paper also provides a sobering reminder of the reality of some of these properties.</p>
<p><em>While public participation is certainly possible with Blockchain technology, as there are many examples of systems built using Blockchain technology that fail to achieve these properties. For example, while Bitcoin initially had a low-cost to participate allowing easy-of-entry for miners and community ownership, that is no longer the case as any meaningful participation requires the purchase of a large amount of specialized hardware and the expenditure of a significant amount of electricity.</em></p>
<p>To conclude, here&#39;s an enumeration of the different use cases for blockchain technology:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Financial</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Electronic currencies and payments</li>
<li>Asset trading</li>
<li>Markets and auctions</li>
<li>Insurance and futures</li>
<li>Penalties, remedies, and sanctions</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Data storage and sharing</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Asset tracking</li>
<li>Identity and key management</li>
<li>Multi-organization data sharing</li>
<li>Tamper-resistant record storage</li>

<li>Others</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Voting</li>
<li>Gambling and games</li>
<li>IoT and smart property</li>
</ol>
<p>These use cases apply a combination of the normative properties of blockchain and its core capabilities. A full explanation is given in the paper and it generally follows the format of use case &gt; challenge at hand &gt; core capability helping to resolve the challenge &gt; limitations.</p>

<p>SoK: Research Perspectives and Challenges for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies. 2015. 104-121. 10.1109/SP.2015.14. </p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides a systematic exposition of Bitcoin and other ‘altcoins&#39;</li>
<li>Identifies three major components of Bitcoin</li>
<li>Maps out the design space for proposed modifications </li>
<li>Survey anonymity issues in Bitcoin</li>
<li>Provides new insights on disintermediation protocols </li>
</ul>
<p>One point that we find quite interesting is that this is a pre-ethereum paper which was published in 2015</p>
<p>Now we will break down some of the key phrases that the paper highlights which will form the backbone for further research studies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple majority compliance may not ensure fairness</strong></li>
<li>Temporary withholding block withholding can allow miners who are two blocks ahead of the largest publicly known chain to publish the withheld block without any opposition. </li>
<li><strong>Majority compliance is an equilibrium with perfect information</strong></li>
<li>On analysing a simplified model where miners have perfect information about all published blocks, it is found that universal compliance is a <em>Nash equilibrium</em>. </li>
<li><strong>Majority compliance implies convergence, consensus, and liveness</strong></li>
<li>With a majority of the miners working compaintly it can be shown that a single, longest correct chain can easily emerge. When the original <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">Bitcoin paper </a>modeled a malicious miner looking to reverse a transaction by building an alternate chain faster than the honest chain, it was shown that this miner would eventually lose this race to the network.  </li>
<li><strong>With a majority miner, stability is not guaranteed</strong></li>
<li>A single non-compliant miner that controls the majority of the network could undermine fairness by:</li>
<li>Collecting all block rewards</li>
<li>Arbitrarily censoring transactions  </li>
<li>Introducing arbitrarily long forks in the blockchain </li>
<li><strong>If miners can collude, stability is not known</strong></li>
<li>Even with the absence of a miner that controls the majority of the network&#39;s mining resources, a group of individual miners can collude and form cartels that control the majority of the mining power.</li>
<li><strong>Stability is not known as mining rewards decline</strong></li>
<li>All of these results have used a simplified model in which each block carries a constant, fixed reward fee. The planned transition of miner revenue from block rewards to transaction fees will negate this assumption and require more complex models which take into account the distribution of available transaction fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will now go over the two strategies that give miners, who don&#39;t purely derive utility only through mining rewards, an advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold-Finger attack: </li>
<li>Majority Miner&#39;s Goal: To explicitly attack Bitcoin&#39;s security and destroy its utility as a currency</li>
<li>These attacks have already been observed thorough what has been known as altcoin infanticide: Deep forking attacks in new, competing currencies which has been successfully launched by Bitcoin miners</li>
<li>Feather Forking: </li>
<li>Majority Miner&#39;s Goal: To censor a blacklist of transactions </li>
<li>This is done by the miner by publicly promising that the blacklisted transaction which has been included in the blockchain will be intentionally ignored by the attacker who would attempt to fork the blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, for this paper we have just summarized and broken down what we believe are potential research questions that this paper highlights. You are highly encouraged to read the original paper and do a breakdown of your own. </p>

      <google-codelab-step label="P1: A Technical Overview of Bitcoin" duration="0">
        <ul>
<li>Sources of information on Bitcoin: Good overview presented in the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">original whitepaper</a>. Knowledge on current implementation: <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips" target="_blank">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals</a>, <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wiki</a> articles, <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev" target="_blank">Developers Mailing Lists</a>, Logged Bitcoin <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/IRC_channels" target="_blank">IRC Discussions</a>.</li>
<li>Transactions and Scripts</li>
<li>Transaction Format: an array of inputs and an array of outputs hashed using SHA-256. This hash: Unique transaction ID</li>
<li>Transaction Scripts: &#34;pay-to-pub-key-hash&#34; refers to a hash of the public key and a signature validation routine. Opcodes is the <em>ad-hoc</em>, <em>non-turing complete stack scripting language</em> that is used.</li>
<li>Conservation of Value: Transactions are valid only if they satisfy the constraint of the sum of values of transaction inputs being less than or equal to the sum of the values of all the inputs.</li>
<li>Transaction to Ownership: The concept of ownership of Bitcoins is different from that of traditional assets. An owner: Someone who knows a private key that can make a signature that redeems certain outputs.</li>
<li>Consensus and Mining:</li>
<li>Nakamoto Consensus: (Details out the process involved in choosing a new block) </li>
<li>The first announced valid block containing the solution to a computational puzzle is considered correct, following which other participants (referred to as miners) should start working towards finding a follow up block. </li>
<li>Malformed blocks and those with invalid transactions are meant to be rejected by the participants.</li>
<li>At any given point in time the consensus blockchain: longest chain. <em>Finding the solution at the same time leads to temporary forking of the main chain with two chains of equal length</em>.</li>
<li>Block conformations: Due to the possibility of forking of the main chain, users need to wait for 6 blocks to be found to confirm that their transaction would be permanently included in the blockchain. The choice of 6 has been set arbitrarily.</li>
<li>Incentivising correct behaviour: Any miner who is able to find the correct solution to the computational hash problem gets a<em> block reward</em>. This gives miners an incentive to work only on valid blocks (What is valid is determined by the majority of other miners)</li>
<li>Mining details: The puzzle is to find a block (consisting of a list of transactions, hash of the previous block, timestamp, version no. and a nonce) whose SHA-256 hash is less than a target value.</li>
<li>Can be modeled as a problem to find a hash that starts with d consecutive zeros</li>
<li>The standard strategy: Simply try random nonces</li>
<li>Mining rewards: The size of the block reward is determined by a fixed schedule. It was initially set to 50 Bitcoin and is set to half every 4 years. Most miners also profit from transaction fees that users add to their transaction to ensure a higher probability of their transaction being included in the next block.</li>
<li>Mining pools: In practice, many miners collaborate and form certain mining pools to lower the variance of their rewards by sharing rewards with a group of other miners. This is a threat to Bitcoin&#39;s decentralization. </li>
<li>Peer to peer communication network:</li>
<li>Impact on consensus: Performance and stability of the network has an impact on the consensus protocol</li>
<li>Latency between block discovery and its receipt by all other nodes increases the chances of a temporary fork.</li>
<li>A malicious node who is able to control the majority of the network can favour the broadcast of their own blocks.</li>
<li>Network topology and discovery: Any node can join the network by connecting to a random sample of other nodes. By default, each node attempts to make 8 outgoing connections and is prepared to receive up to 125 incoming connections. Bitcoin makes use of seed nodes to allow peers to find out about other peers in the network.</li>
<li>Communication Protocol: New blocks and pending transactions are broadcast to the entire network by flooding.</li>
<li>INV messages: Sent by nodes to all other peers containing hashes of new blocks and pending transactions </li>
<li>GETDATA messages: Peers can request the content of these new blocks and transactions </li>
<li>Replay policy: Bitcoin has a set of stricter validation rules when compared to general transaction validity rules to decide what transactions and blocks can be a relayed to the network. This is done in order to prevent denial of service attacks. </li>
</ul>

      <google-codelab-step label="P2: &#34;Smart&#34; contracts" duration="45">
        <p>Before learning how to code/execute a smart contract, you should first understand what is a smart contract, what are some limitations and how it is used in real life scenarios.</p>
<p>What is a smart contract?</p>
<p>A <em>smart contract</em> is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a <em>contract</em>. Once the terms of the contract has been fulfilled by the parties, the smart contract will self-execute. Clauses and data of the smart contract will have to be digitally programmed and fed into the blockchain by a trusted third party, known as the oracle. These oracles are often linked to the Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices, which allow the automated monitoring of data. </p>
<p>The beauty of the decentralized nature of blockchain based peer to peer transactions means that these smart contracts don‘t require anything in the way of a middleman. Traditionally individuals or institutions such as banks and solicitors were required to facilitate legally binding contracts. Smart contracts allow individuals to bypass these costly and often slow middlemen and agree on a contract directly.  (<a href="https://www.devteam.space/blog/10-uses-for-smart-contracts/" target="_blank">https://www.devteam.space/blog/10-uses-for-smart-contracts/</a>)</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\e0d637e594318691.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Benefits of Smart Contracts</li>
<li><strong>Autonomy</strong> – Decentralized nature of the blockchain contracts underlying these smart contracts as well as the nature of the contract themselves means no outside party is required in the process. </li>
<li><strong>More secure</strong> – Blockchain technology creates unalterable ledgers that provide definitive proof of transactions. It also relies on encryption while operating as a secure peer to peer transaction system.</li>
<li><strong>Faster speeds </strong>– Unlike traditional contracts, there is no need for a middleman which reduces  the waiting time and increases the speed in which the contract can be drafted, signed and executed.</li>
<li><strong>Increased accuracy</strong> – Humans make mistakes, smart contracts are designed not to.</li>
<li><strong>Cost savings</strong> – The automated process lowers costs significantly.</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong> – Unalterable ledgers mean transactions are set in stone</li>
<li><strong>Backup</strong> – Data storage devices can fail. Smart contracts duplicate all transactions so that all parties have a record of the transitions. The likelihood that all parties are going to suffer data storage failures is practically nonexistent.</li>
</ul>
<p>(<a href="https://www.devteam.space/blog/10-uses-for-smart-contracts/" target="_blank">https://www.devteam.space/blog/10-uses-for-smart-contracts/</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Limitations to this smart contract</li>
<li><strong>Immutability</strong>  - As smart contracts are coded onto blockchain, once set up, the contracts cannot be modified easily. However, it is very common for parties to amendment terms and conditions, especially for long-term contracts whose execution is depending on real-life dynamics. Therefore the rigidity in smart contracts will lead to a  wide array of practical problems more so with respect to the ease of modifying the contract terms depending on various situations. </li>
<li><strong>Contractual Secrecy</strong> -  the transactions are visible, and there is no security of such. Despite the nodes being anonymous, the maintenance of a public ledger in the distributed environment results in a privacy lapse</li>
<li><strong>Legal Adjudications and Enforceability</strong> - Traditionally, the establishment of a valid contract covers various constructs such as offer by one party or parties, acceptance by the other party or parties, a promise, consideration, and legal capacity mutuality and in some contracts, a written instrument. Some elements are not applicable to smart contracts and therefore regulations need to come up with a new set of enforcement to prove a smart contract to be valid</li>

<ul>
<li>Finance Industry</li>
</ul>
<p>Smart contracts are gaining the most traction in the finance industry and many financial institutions are adopting blockchain and smart contracts to simplify and digitize their process. The Swiss Bank, UBS has recently adopted the use of blockchain and smart contracts to create a self-paying instrument which will be risk-free and is an available payment stream for the unbanked people. This kind of micro contracts can enable microfinancing which can help in the payment of everyday goods. </p>
<ul>
<li>Healthcare</li>
</ul>
<p>The healthcare industry faces several issues pertaining to data conservation and patient privacy. With the use of Smart contracts, middlemen can be eliminated. Applicature, a blockchain development application was developed through smart contracts to foster data integrity, transparency and secure record of patients&#39; health data. </p>
<ul>
<li>Music Industry</li>
</ul>
<p>An example from the Music Industry is Inmusik, a music streaming platform that decentralizes revenues and has a proper allocation of revenues to the respective artists, solving one of the common issues in the music streaming industry. A common issue faced in the music industry is that revenues fail to reach the content creators&#39; hand due to centralization, lack of transparency over ownership of the content, royalties payment and many more. With the help of smart contracts, Inmusik enables the validation of the ownership of a song through a transparent tagging system. As a result, the party who creates the track gets the right portion of fees allocated from the royalties. </p>

<p>These are some of the many few real examples that industries and companies have adopted smart contracts to simplify and digitize their operations, introducing transparency and accuracy which reduces cost. Really, smart contracts will soon be used in your everyday life. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s dive right into real smart contracts on the blockchain. Smart contracts are compiled before being migrated onto the blockchain. Thus you need to decompile them.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li><strong>Choose </strong>a smart contract from <a href="https://www.stateofthedapps.com/platforms/ethereum" target="_blank">State of the dapps</a></li>
<li><strong>Decompile </strong>it with <a href="https://www.eveem.org/api" target="_blank">eveem</a> by Tomas Kolinko</li>
<li><strong>Understand</strong> the decompiled code, formatting it properly might help!</li>
<li><strong>Discuss </strong>with your partner what this smart contract does</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> with the class</li>

<li>Some basic checks on deciding price upper and lower limits</li>

</aside>
<p>This information presented in this section is obtained from the paper: Issuing and Verifying Digital Certificates with Blockchain, which can be accessed <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8587428" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>The problem: </p>
<ul>
<li>Counterfeit certificates being issued </li>
<li>Lengthy process involving the verification of a large number of certificates </li>
</ul>
<p>The solution that is being proposed: UniCert (Based on UniCoin, a digital currency built on blockchain technology)</p>
<p>Existing solution: Blockcert</p>
<ul>
<li>What it does: Joins the Bitcoin network and makes use of its transaction structure to maintain certificate records.</li>
<li>Why use the Bitcoin network: Transparency and Availability </li>
<li>Potential Drawbacks: </li>
<li>By tying itself to the Bitcoin network, it also ties itself to the Bitcoin market at fluctuating rates resulting in the issuing of certificates to become unpredictable. </li>
<li>With the scale of the Bitcoin network increasing, it becomes more expensive for new nodes to join the network due to expensive fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>How does UniCerts work?:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Collection of necessary information for the certification process</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hashing of the certificate and storing it in the metadata of the transaction. The hashing is carried out using the Merkle Tree hashing algorithm </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pushing of transactions into UniCerts thereby letting it join the validation process</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Receiving the certificate&#39;s hash as an identity number once the transaction validations is complete </p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Retrieving the original certificate wherever necessary which requires the identity number </p>
<p>How does this address the existing issues revolving around the current system:</p>
<ul>
<li>It prevents counterfeit certificates from being issued since all the certificates that are validated through the system and a unique identity is provided to determine the validity of these referenced certificates.</li>
<li>The lengthy validation is shortened since the entire process happens by pushing transactions into UniCerts rather than going through a centralised authority overseeing the entire process of issuing these certificates. </li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, you are highly encouraged to go back and do your own teardown of the paper and understand the UniCerts and UniCoin architecture by yourself! This section covers the rough overview of the project and does not go into the architecture. </p>
<p>Other exciting blockchain focused solutions to this problem that you are encouraged to check out are: <a href="https://0xcert.org/news/certificates-and-licences/" target="_blank">0xcert</a> and  <a href="https://opencerts.io/" target="_blank">OpenCerts</a>.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="P2: Working with blockchain: Dev tools" duration="20">
        <p>Dev tools are important as it reduces development time. </p>
<p>To interact with the blockchain, it is common to start with <strong>geth</strong>, which will install the whole ethereum blockchain on your computer. However this might take hours, which is not practical if you are trying out blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Therefore to allow you to work with the Ethereum blockchain without running a full node there are several methods such as; </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li><strong>Infura</strong>, a hosted Ethereum node cluster that lets your users run your application without requiring them to set up their own Ethereum node or wallet</li>
<li><strong>Web3js, </strong>make requests to an individual Ethereum node with <em>JSON RPC </em>in order to read and write data to the network</li>
<li><strong>HDWalletProvider</strong>, for account management process required when signing transactions on the blockchain such as metamask</li>
</ol>
<p>This list is not exhaustive as new and better ways are still being created. </p>
<p>To work even faster especially for proofs-of-concepts or hackathons, we can use <strong>Ganache</strong>. <strong>Ganache</strong> is a popular personal ethereum client which you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates. </p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\61b9fe3cb65f79ff.png"></p>
<p>Most tutorials have their networks deployed on a mix of <strong>Ganache</strong> and <strong>Ethereum testnet(s) connected via infura</strong>.</p>
<p>To speed up the development and code testing, we have <strong>Truffle</strong> which is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum. <code>truffle init</code> creates the following file structure, which provides the base for our project.</p>
<p>File structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>contracts/: Contains the<a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">Solidity</a> source files for our smart contracts. There is an important contract in here called <code>Migrations.sol</code>, which we&#39;ll talk about later.</li>
<li>migrations/: Truffle uses a migration system to handle smart contract deployments. A migration is an additional special smart contract that keeps track of changes.</li>
<li>test/: Contains both JavaScript and Solidity tests for our smart contracts</li>
<li>truffle-config.js: Truffle configuration file</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a short walkthrough of truffle commands for creating and setting up your project. </p>
<p>1. <em>truffle init</em> : generates sample files for solidity contracts</p>
<p>2. edit solidity smart contracts</p>
<p>3. <em>truffle compile</em> : compiles .sol into .json format</p>
<p>4. <em>ganache-cli</em> : starts ganache-cli, make sure ganache-cli is already installed (this step is only for deployment on ganache, else skip this step)</p>
<p>5. create a 2deploycontracts.js file with code to export module</p>
<p>6. update truffle.js configuration for module.exports networks</p>
<p>7. <em>truffle migrate</em> (--network ropsten) (--reset): deployment of contracts on ganache/ ropsten / redeploy contract even though one with the same solidity code has been previously deployed.</p>
<p>- <em>truffle console</em> : console to run web3apis to interact with web3 JS apis (link below) (e.g. web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt or calling functions from the smart contracts by using</p>
<p>Bounties.deployed().then(function(instance) {...})</p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t decided on a code editor, use <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>! There&#39;s dark mode, syntax highlighting is pretty and there is a decent <strong>Solidity Syntax Plugin by Juan Blanco</strong> for Visual Studio Code you can download which is especially useful since many tutorials online have outdated solidity code and this handy code editor can remind you of the new solidity code syntax.</p>

        <p>From the pace at which the development tools in blockchains are developed and new versions of solidity language are pushed out, it is common that the tutorial you have been following is outdated and you&#39;ll are sitting in broken code. When in doubt, google! You&#39;ll be likely directed to issues on github pages or stackoverflow and you can follow their instructions.</p>
<p><em>But what should i do if i don&#39;t know where the problem is? </em>It goes without saying that a good understanding of would be very beneficial to the debugging process. I highly recommend getting started with the articles on the ethereum developers page where just the introductory section is enough to get a good understanding of how the compilation and deployment process works. The truffle links they provide are also helpful if you are looking to write your projects in truffle. Here&#39;s the page: <a href="https://ethereum.org/developers/" target="_blank">https://ethereum.org/developers/</a></p>
<p>If you are looking to develop an app which requires reading the state of some part of the blockchain, knowledge of web3js and how metamask works would be helpful.</p>
<p><em>Sometimes there is more than one problem.</em> When I was editing the code for the project on voting, I noticed that the Event always on loading if metamask is enabled in browser. So i went to the place in the code where I check if there is a current provider for web3 and perform a few console logs to check the state of my accounts and voila! I found my problem: Web3.getaccounts returned an empty array. With help from stack overflow i picked the possible underlying problems (solvable with actions):</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem 1: metamask would not be injected on local files, so in order to access my metamask account, use the Chrome extension <strong>Web Server for Chrome</strong> to convert local file (e.g //newfile) to https://127.00.02</li>
<li>Problem 2: To unlock my account, I have to write code to enable metamask (which prompts the user to allow site access to the account) as part of metamask&#39;s privacy feature (new!)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, some knowledge of how these things work is essential to pinpoint the location of the error (in this case I checked web3.currentProvider). And from there onwards stack overflow and github issues help to identify the deprecated features and other developer&#39;s workaround to the issue with the correct keywords.</p>
<p>Other interesting issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Callback for web3js required (fixed with web3js v1.0 as it uses promises now!)</li>
<li>Restoration of accounts on metamask and what I learnt about how accounts are generated on metamask</li>
</ul>

<p>You should see something similar to this! This is your IDE for basic smart contracts! Play around and get(h) used to it.</p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>You can customise your solidity compiler by choosing the solidity plugin. You can change it to 0.6.6 as that&#39;s the version we will be using throughout this course.</li>
<li>Once you&#39;re familiar with the IDE, create a new file named Greeter.sol and paste the smart contract code into it (available below).</li>
<li>Save the file once and you should see it compile automatically. Make sure you see the green tick next to the solidity compiler which signifies a successful compilation.</li>
<li>Head to the deploy and run transactions (the one below solidity compiler on the left nav bar). Change the environment to Injected Web3 (this is to make sure that you deploy to the actual blockchain and not a temporary local one. You will most likely get a MetaMask prompt and <em>make sure that you connect your account on the ropsten network!</em><img style="width: 63.67px" src="img\3c13ad7aac7062d2.png"></li>
<li>Leave the gas limit and value as is (tweak if you know what you&#39;re doing) and go down to the deploy section. </li>

<li>Choose a greeting string for the constructor. Remember, once you choose a word, you cannot change it as it is permanently stored on the blockchain! Hit deploy. Confirm your transaction with MetaMask.</li>
<li>Once the transaction has been mined (you will get a notification from MetaMask). You can see the address of the deployed contract! Hurray!

<ul>
<li>Notice that the string parameter in the constructor is tagged with memory.</li>
<li>There are two types of variables in smart contracts: <code>storage</code> and <code>memory</code>.</li>
<li>Storage - variables permanently stored on the blockchain (similar to pass by reference)</li>
<li>Memory - temporary variables erased between external function calls (similar to pass by value)</li>
<li>Storage variables can only interact within the contract ecosystem as the memory address of the variables have no meaning outside the Ethereum Virtual Machine.</li>
<li>Question: Can public functions (which can be called from outside the blockchain) have storage parameters?</li>
<li>You might be familiar with public and private modifiers but what about the view modifier?</li>
<li>View functions only read the data from the blockchain but doesn&#39;t write to the blockchain.</li>
<li>View functions hence don&#39;t cost gas. Gas is needed to run code on the blockchain that changes the storage of the contract.</li>
<li><code>msg.sender:</code> Each function call can access the address of the caller of the function through this variable.</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="P3: How to make METH" duration="40">
        <p>Before you get all excited, we will be making a MetaEther/MyEther. Our own currency backed by the blockchain/smart contracts. There are a few standards for tokens like ERC20 and ERC721. ERC20 tokens hold the same value and are interchangeable (a good fit for a currency).</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Deploy</h2>
<p>Before we get into deploying our own currency, let us take a look at the standards. OpenZeppelin has a list of smart contracts that are tried and tested and they&#39;ve made it open-source for all of us to use. Yay! They have contracts like SafeMath, ERC20 and Ownable that are widely used. Most production-ready smart contracts usually inherit from one of the OpenZeppelin contracts. You can take a look at all their contracts <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/" target="_blank">here</a>. We will be using their ERC20 Contract to make our own ETH.</p>
<p>Ownable is used when contracts have an owner who has admin privileges that normal users don&#39;t. SafeMath is used to prevent overflows during math operations.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Logic</h2>
<p>This section is a little light on coding. The ERC20 Standard Interface and its implementation is given below (a shorter version of the OpenZeppelin Contract). We will just inherit it, in our contract.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Code</strong></h2>
<p>Below is the syntax for your contract.</p>

<p>Further Points to note on the Syntax</p>
<ul>
<li>Events are for you to communicate that something happened on the blockchain to your app frontend</li>
<li>Events can also be used as a gas-cheap way to burn data into the blockchain rather than storing it in the storage of your contract</li>
<li>You can fire an event using the <code>emit</code> keyword.</li>
<li>Require: This statement allows you to check a condition and immediately end the transaction/function call if the condition is not satisfied. It is similar to assertion.</li>
<li>Floating point numbers are not supported in Solidity yet. One way to bypass this is to use smaller units. Example, you can send 1.5 Ether using Smart contracts. But behind the scenes, Ether is converted to wei, which is the smallest unit of token. (1018 wei = 1 ether). You cannot divide a wei.</li>
<li>Payable: This is a very important keyword when it comes to writing smart contracts. All it takes for your function to accept Ether is to add this keyword as a modifier. </li>
<li>When a user calls your function (either directly or through web3), they can specify how much ether (in wei) that they want to send. This value can be accessed through <code>msg.value</code>.</li>
<li>Once some money is sent to the smart contract, it stays in the smart contracts&#39; balance (can be accessed through <code>address(this).balance</code>) and you can also transfer funds from the contract to an address using transfer. Make sure the address is payable too!</li>

<p>Further points on the syntax</p>
<ul>
<li>You can make your own modifiers in Solidity! Like how there is public/private. You can also restrict the access further using custom modifiers (you can also use modifiers to execute common code)</li>
<li>Modifiers are half-functions that are used to modify other functions, usually to check some requirements prior to execution. They are executed first, before the function itself, during a function call.</li>
<li>We use _; to give the control back to the function. Think of it as a compulsory return statement when writing modifiers.</li>
<li>In the above example, if a function has the checkSenderIsRegistered, only registered users can successfully call the function</li>
<li>Modifiers can have parameters also, as you will see in the final challenge!</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Discuss</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Why is this question-answer app flawed?(ie. people from scoring multiple points with same question, answer checks for exact string and a different way of expressing the same answer would not award you the point.)</li>
<li>What are some added functions that would be useful? (ie. a constraint that allows one answer after every question is asked would prevent people from scoring multiple points with same question)</li>
